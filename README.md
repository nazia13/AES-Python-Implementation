This is an exercise in symmetric-key encryption, specifically the Advanced Encryption Standard - 128.
It is implemented in pure python. This code is only intended for recreational purposes and should not be used in secure systems.

# What's in the Code
- AES-128 implementation that accepts 16 byte Plaintext and Key and returns the corresponding 16 byte Ciphertext.

# Usage
  python2 AESImplementation.py
  
  
### TODO
* Add 192 and 256 bit implementations of AES.
* Modify code for allowing input of more than 16 bytes.
